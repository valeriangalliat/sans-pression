## 😋 Tasting

Lavender is overpowering, tastes like 4% shampoo. Not good.

Got better over time after a few months but still not my favorite.
Should have put way less lavender.

According to [this thread](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/adding-lavender-to-the-boil.414985/)
should have been just a teaspoon and probably in secondary close to
bottling.
