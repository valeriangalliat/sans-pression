# 🍺 Milkshake session mango NEIPA

> 📝 Session NEIPA with lactose and mango.

##  ⚖️ Ingredient (6 gallons)

### 🌾 Grains

* 5 lb golden promise malt
* 5 lb honey malt
* 1 lb pale wheat malt
* 1 lb flaked oats

So we started from the original NEIPAnanas recipe but wanted to tweak it
a bit.

I randomly decided instead of using 100 g of honey malt we could replace
the whole pale malt base with it and use a bit more than 2 kg instead,
quoting myself earlier this year, "ça se tente, fuck it".

This "NEIPA" is hella fucking dark right now, like I've seen darker
brown ales than that. Supposedly more than 10% of honey malt is overly
sweet, so I'm curious what will be the result when we put nearly 50%.

Read the tasting notes down below when I add them because they might be
fucking hilarious.

### 🌿 Hops

* 1 oz Warrior
* 3 oz Cascade
* 3 oz Lemondrop

The original NEIPAnanas we based off featured Warrior, Simcoe and Citra,
but we wanted to try something different (mostly because at least one of
those wasn't available), so we replaced Simcoe and Citra by Cascade and
Lemondrop.

But we probably won't taste shit because I decided to add a fuckton of
honey malt which is likely gonna overpower everything.
