## 🎶 Notes

It barely had any active fermentation, no idea why. Maybe the malt
selection that we did custom for the first time instead of following a
recipe was bad? Maybe we didn't cool it enough or maybe the yeast didn't
like the addition of lactose and vanilla extract?

## 😋 Tasting

It's weirdly sour, but it's not unpleasant, just unexpected. Maybe some
Brett yeast were still present in the carboy and gave that extra
funkiness?

It is carbonated. I was worried with the way it fermented so little that
the yeast would just be dead and adding bottling sugar wouldn't trigger
any refermenting and the beer would be flat. It's not, which makes a
huge difference; we tasted it before bottling and it was pretty
disappointing, but now it's carbonated it's pretty damn good.

It does taste slightly milky, the vanilla is barely present though, we
could have added more extract. It's somewhat bitter as well, maybe not
black IPA bitter but more bitter than I would have expected. Not
unpleasant either.

We didn't measure the alcohol level, but it is definitely lighter than
expected, at least a session if not close to a nonalcoholic beer? You do
get the kick of a proper beer when you drink it so I would think there's
at least 3 or 4%.

I had very little hope for this beer after seeing the way it fermented
(or mostly, didn't ferment), I had mixed feelings when tasting it flat
when bottling, like it wasn't undrinkable garbage that we would need to
dump down the sink but wasn't good either, but was really surprised
after it carbonated, it's actually fucking good.

The taste is not common which is actually something I like when drinking
beer, but sometimes can be a bit off-putting (e.g. some very smoky beers
I love to drink a taster of but would definitely not appreciate a full
pint). This one though is pleasing enough that I wanted more after
drinking just one glass, which is a very good sign.
