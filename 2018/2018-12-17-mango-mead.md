## 😋 Tasting

Pretty flat and bitter.

Maybe dried mango isn't a good idea and should have used fresh mangoes
(maybe boiled) with their juice? Or maybe could have waited longer (e.g.
1 year or even 2) before tasting? Maybe should have waited a couple
months of fermentation before adding the dried mango?
