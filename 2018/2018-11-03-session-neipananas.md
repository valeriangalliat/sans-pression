## 😋 Tasting

Smells like pineapple, but really dry (as in not sweet at all). Good
hoppy taste without being overwhelmingly bitter, with some hop fruity
notes. Very light (guessing 3.5 to 4.5 percent), super easy to drink.
Makes for a perfect refreshing and thirst-quenching sport beer.

Would have liked it to have more pineapple character. Hoping for the
Session NEIPAnanas Impériale with dry hopped pineapple will bring this.
