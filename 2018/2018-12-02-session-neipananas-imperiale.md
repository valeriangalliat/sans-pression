## 😋 Tasting

Smells like sweet pineapple, happy to see that the dry hopped pineapple
did help keeping its sweetness. However tastes a lot like the Session
NEIPAnanas, there's not much if any added pineapple taste or sweetness
on the palate. Very light as well (also 3.5 to 4.5 percent), super easy
to drink. Makes for a perfect refreshing and thirst-quenching sport
beer.

The sweet smell makes me slightly prefer it to the Session NEIPAnanas,
we'll definitely go for more dry hopped fruits in the future. However we
need a way to give it a more fruity taste as opposed to only smell.

The active fermentation started a couple days later than expected, and
we dry hopped including the pineapple while it was probably still
active, as it really picked up a bit after and stayed active for a
couple more days. Maybe if we would have waited the active fermentation
to be absolutely done before dry hopping the taste would have been more
fruity.

We'll need to try this recipe again at some point to verify this point.
Can't go wrong as regardless of the fruitiness, I still love this beer.
