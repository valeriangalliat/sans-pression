## ✍️ Notes

Even though half of the [lavender Hefeweizen](../2021/2021-11-06-lavender-hefeweizen.md),
3 g was still probably way too much.

And according to [this thread](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/adding-lavender-to-the-boil.414985/)
it would have been better to add it in secondary instead of during
boil (and in much smaller quantity still).

We'll see what it turns out like.
