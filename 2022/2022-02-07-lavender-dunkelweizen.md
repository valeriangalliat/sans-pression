## ✍️ Notes

Even though half of the [lavender Hefeweizen](../2021/2021-11-06-lavender-hefeweizen.md),
3 g was still probably way too much.

And according to [this thread](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/adding-lavender-to-the-boil.414985/)
it would have been better to add it in secondary instead of during
boil (and in much smaller quantity still).

We'll see what it turns out like.

Also like the two previous 1 gallon recipes using 3 L mash and 3 L
sparge, I didn't fully fill the gallon jar fermenter. Should probably do
4 L mash then 4 or 5 L sparge next time. It looks like recipes for 1
gallon commonly use 9 L of water total.
