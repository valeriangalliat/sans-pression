## OxySan

Use 1 table spoon for 1 gallon of warm water.

Usually, we do half a table spoon for whatever pot is about 2 liters.

## Boil

Higher temperature will result in sweeter beer, lower temperature will
result in dryer beer.

## Brewing

If the yeast is refrigerated, might as well get it out right now and
activate it.

Rinse bucket, medium (19 L) cauldron and big cauldron (with spigot).

Basically fill the 19 L cauldron for the usual 18.5 L of water for the
mash, and heat it up (unless need a different amount of water, then
measure with bucket).

Put the filter bag in the big cauldron and the grains in the filter bag.
Pour the hot water in when it's at the right temperature.

Pretty much right after, use the bucket to get the right amount of water
for rinsing the grains (usually 15 L), pour it in the 19 L cauldron and
start to heat it up so it's at the right temperature when the mash is
done.

When the mash is ready, drain the first part into the bucket and cover
it.

Rinse the grains with the water from the 19 L cauldron that's already
ready and to the right temperature. If the cauldron is on the floor at
that point, won't hurt to leave it there.

After 15 minutes, take the filter bag out using gloves (it's hot) and put
it away. Now the cauldron is less heavy, put it on the burner, and then
pour the mash in it as well.

If not using a filter bag, after the 15 minutes, drain the rest into the
19 L cauldron (and not into the bucket), as it's gonna be easier to pour
two reasonable quantities from two different recipients than a big
quantity from a single recipient (will help prevent to make a mess).
Then, after rinsing the big cauldron, pour back the mash from the two
recipients into the cauldron for the boil.

Add hops according to recipe.

At least 15 minutes before the end of the boil, put the wort chiller
into the boiling mash to give it time to be sanitized by the boil. Plug
the plastic tubes to the wort chiller before putting it in as after this
the copper will be hot.

When done with the boil, start running cool water through the wort
chiller.

While it's cooling, prepare OxySan (see ratio above) and sanitize the
carboy.

When cooled down, remove the wort chiller and pour the wort from the
cauldron into the carboy using the spigot.

Sanitize the yeast bag before adding the yeast, then gently mix.

Sanitize the blow-off tube and put sanitized water into the blow-off
jar, or sanitize the airlock, and set up the blow-of or the airlock.
